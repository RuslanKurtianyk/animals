        <h5>CATS</h5>
        <p>The domestic cat[1][5] (Latin: Felis catus) or the feral cat[5][3] (Latin: Felis silvestris catus) is a small, 
        typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when 
        there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines.[6] Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and 
        for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds; different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.

Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to 
killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for 
human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color 
vision and a better sense of smell than humans. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a 
variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting), as well as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.[7]</p>
